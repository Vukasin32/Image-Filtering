# Image filtering
This was a university assignment for the "Digital Image Processing" class. <br/>
Idea of project is to implement image filtering from scratch, using matrix operations.<br/>
In this code it is demontrated use case for blur and edges filter.<br/>
It is important to mention that code is implemented in a way that assigned 2D filter can be arbitrary in dimensions.
<br/>Technologies that were used:
- MATLAB
